      {description-intro}

      Builds on the 'staging' branch automatically trigger a deployment
      of that image to the staging environment.

      Only the staging branch is automatically built.
      Other branches may be manually built via `Build with Parameters`.

      Historic builds can be manually deployed to either staging or production,
      by running the 'Deploy to Production' or the 'Deploy to Staging' build promotions.
      (This won't work for builds that were not pushed to ECR --
      currently, only staging/master images get pushed to ECR).

          description: |
            If specified, jenkins will use this git branch to build.
            If not, jenkins will pick a branch (between 'master' and 'staging')
            that seems most likely to be the one you want built.
            This is usually either the branch that has commits in it that jenkins hasn't 'seen' yet,
            or, if there are none of those, the most recently-built branch.
